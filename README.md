# Module 1 Final Project

## Introduction

In this project, I will use datasets from four major movie-related websites:
    
    - IMDB
    - TMDB
    - Box Office Mojo
    - Rotten Tomatoes
    
to gain some insight in what effects profit/rating in movie industry.


## Question research

    1. The relationship between Genre and Profit/Reputation 
    2. The relationshp betwwen Release Time and Gross Income
    3. The relationship between Studio and Profit/Reputation
    * Profit is net income, which equals domestic income + worldwide income - budget
    * I used average for all income/reputation
    
    
## Datasets

    I take a look at the Zipped data and choose 4 file that has all information I need for my research questions.
        1. imdb.title.basics.csv.gz
        2. tn.movie_budgets.csv.gz
        3. zippedData/bom.movie_gross.csv.gz
        4. zippedData/tmdb.movies.csv.gz

    I make notefoot to explain the codes. Basically there are 5 parts:
        1. Clean and merge datasets, one by one
        2. Relationship between Genre and Profit (only movies in top 500 net income are considered)
        3. Relationship between Genre and Reputation (only vote count > 100 are considered. Low ratings are not representative)
        4. Relationship between Release time and Gross Income (only movies in top 500 gross income are considered)
        5. Which studio makes better movie (choose top 5 studios from vote average/profit)
